Fire From Heaven is a solo project started by Andrew Hopper, which takes a modern/technical metalcore sound to the symphonic metal world, having unique melodic riffs hitherto undreamt of in the symphonic metal genre!

> My main message that I hope my music would portray is to Stand fast and do what God calls you to do no matter what the people around you say or what the odds of success are.
