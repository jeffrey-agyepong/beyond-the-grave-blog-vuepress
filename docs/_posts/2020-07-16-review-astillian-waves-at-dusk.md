**Astillian** is an independent Viking Melodic Death Metal band that was formed in 2016 out of Chicago Il, USA. They’re the brainchild of melodic death metal veterans, _Mike & Dan Gleason_ of **Afterimage**(top-notch band). **_Waves at Dusk_** is a concept album inspired by G.K. Chesterton’s, “The Ballad of the White Horse." It captures the inescapable misery and undeniable hope of the early middle ages; raiding hordes, mass migrations, and kingdoms rising through the discord. This powerful album **_Waves At Dusk_** was fully forged on November 24th of 2017

**Lyrically:** The album speaks of epic bloody battles, legends, and God's sovereignty. The lyricist holds a passion for ancient lore. I must say that listening to these lyrics and reading them is quite fun.

> “Flee from your homes, never bury your dead / The fallen men, never forgotten / Then the terror begins to bring the day of vengeance / When wandering becomes a perilous path to tread.” - Astillian(Track 4)

**Sonically:** This album is hard-hitting, I can imagine the singer mightily raising his sword against a horde of enemies as he screams in an unearthly manner (excellent vocals). Mike Gleason's vocals are very dynamic, with vocal ranging from low gutturals to high screams. There are so many great melodies to be heard in this album, and softer parts that give the listener time to reflect on whatever they may. The drums roll like rain falling upon battle beaten shields. Sound effects such as fires being lit, soft ocean waves, and battle can be heard posing as excellent cinematic elements.

**Favorite tracks:** Cloudburst and Shieldwall

**Cloudburst** has the most "metal" lyrics I've heard in a while. The song is just epic, thunderous, and fearsome. If I heard this song playing from an opposing Viking ship, I would flee!

> I have sailed to hell, inhaled the fire And turned to breathe it back I have persevered against the trial And never turned away I have beckoned every nation to see Triumph bestowed on us I will wear the crown, given by God And command these mighty men

**Shieldwall** is one of the most melodic and noble-sounding songs of the album.

**Overall:** The album packs a real punch that is sure to break any boredom the listener may have been experiencing beforehand. So raise the anchor and set sail into this album!
