I don’t like you, go away, With the strange opinions, that you claim! I don’t like you, go away, don’t touch me with your sinful hands! We need assimilation more than diversity! The indoctrination is purging your belief. Sufferance is the only reason, why you still breathe.“ Pluralism, multiculturalism are human‘s achievements, that we would be missin‘ proselytization and fascism result in the question: How can I fit in?“

Tolerance is based on identity and empathy Tolerance is the key to a society, that pursuits of the peacekeeping, we were bleeding for. Let us end the everlasting wars. Accept each other for charity’s sake! We want the structures of hate to break! Accept each other for charity’s sake! We want sympathy and love to awake.
