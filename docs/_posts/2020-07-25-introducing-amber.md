Keep your eye on the bullseye staring down the edge of the barrel Steady and thrilled, what is your kill, If you can fathom Another mark on the target means you're getting closer to nail it Settle the score the bets been placed are you all in?Another mark on the target means your getting closer Another mark on the target means your getting closer

Settle the score, settle the score Bets have been placed, bets have been placed Settle the score, settle the score Are you all in?

There's cards in your hand, but you don't know just how to play them This game of life, takes risk sometimes, you need to play them Fear of the stakes, caused delay, don't look around to see what they say I'm calling your bluff, will you give in, or will you run?

Another mark on the target means your getting closer Another mark on the target means your getting closer

Kill your will destroy to make alive It is he who puts to death, and he who raises you up He brings you down to Hell and lifts you up Kill your will destroy to make alive It is he who puts to death, and he who raises you up He brings you down to Hell and lifts you up

Though he slays me, I will hope Though he wounds me, he will hear Though he slays me, I will hope Though he wounds me, he will hear

Don't hesitate What to say? Vacilitate don't delay At the gate narrow is the way Say his name It'll be okay

Kill your will destroy to make alive. It is he who puts to death, and he who raises you up He brings you down to Hell and lifts you up Kill your will destroy to make alive It is he who puts to death, and he who raises you up He brings you down to Hell and lifts you up
