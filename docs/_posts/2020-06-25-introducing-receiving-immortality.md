You can run you can hide but you can't escape. His love will haunt you to the grave.

Erasing all these memories, this is not who I want to be. Take it and leave it all behind. Take it away from my mind. I'm changing the person that I am. Trying to be the best I can. Spirit-filled and loving again. Renewed into a fruitful man.

I can't go further on my own. What I need is a higher force. Battling this battle with me. Or else it will take over from within. Erupting anger taking my mind. While fear hovers over the land. Even though I know grace is enough, I still doubt my own thoughts.

Finally, I feel remorse for all I've done. It was as if my emotions were partly gone. Your strong love made me weak. Your strong love has healed me. But the fact is that... Now I can see.

Finally, I can see where I went wrong. My own actions led me to this point. But I know that I am forgiven. I'm so humbled for this second chance.

But I can not do it alone. What I need is a higher force. Battling this battle with me. Or else it will take over from within. Erupting anger taking my mind. While fear hovers over the land. Even though I know grace is enough, I still doubt my own thoughts.

Do I dare to say that this a new start? The beginning of a new chapter.

There is always a choice, even if it doesn't seem possible or realistic today. Tomorrow will be a new age. You have a choice. Instead of living in fear of your judgement. you can take your chance to live forever now!
