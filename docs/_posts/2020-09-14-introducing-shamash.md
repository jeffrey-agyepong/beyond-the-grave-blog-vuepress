**Shamash** is a band hailing from Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. First conceived and started by André Chiang of Malaysian Death Metal outfit, Necromanicide. This project started as a tribute to his passion for old-school classic death metal, black metal, and extreme metal genres with a fusion of symphonic and atmospheric elements. What started out a side project gained momentum and the group grew from a solo project to a full band with the edition of Alexaander Joseph Martin (Guitarist of Army of Three) and Finnish drummer Rum "Ola" Pukkönnen.
