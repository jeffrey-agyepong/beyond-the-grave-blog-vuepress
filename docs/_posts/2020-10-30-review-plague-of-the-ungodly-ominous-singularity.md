Released in May earlier this year, **Ominous Singularity** by **Plague of the Ungodly** firmly establishes the band’s position in the genre of Death Metal. A heavy bass line sets the narrative, with fast-paced drums and growling vocals carrying the weight. The band’s [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA5bKNkHYan/) tags the genre as ‘90's deathmetal’ and ‘one-man-band’. For a one-man project, there is an incredible amount of talent displayed on this album.

**Lyrically**, some vocals remain elusive in terms of content. Partially because of the genre, although not in a negative way. Occasionally the vocals separate from the music, clearly identifying a separate track, although they still remain a little unclear. The mix of vocal styles is subtle on the record, with some melodic elements, although the dominant form comes in the nature of the style of **Extol’s _Undeceived_**. Given the album title and the tracklisting, it’s no surprise that much of the lyrics feel weighed down with a menacing sense of foreboding. I reached out to the band and lyrics should be available on [Bandcamp](https://plagueoftheungodly.bandcamp.com/album/ominous-singularity) soon for closer analysis.

**Sonically**, the album sets the tone with the opening track - heavy bass, heavily distorted guitars. At times the upper tones and lyrics appear to dance just above the bass line, with the bass providing a thread that leads the listener through the album. There are elements of 90s metal, with the speed of the drums reminiscent of the (secular) bands _Fear Factory_ and _Strapping Young Lad_. The heaviness of (again, secular) _Sepultura_ and _Soulfly_ comes through in the driving heavy beats that need to be played loud to be fully appreciated. Some comparisons could also be made to _Circle of Dust_ in including electronics to break up the heaviness.

**Overall**, the album sets the tone early on and carries this through to the end. Some of the songs break into lighter elements, and **Ethereal Tides** even starts with the melody before delving into the characteristically heavier sections. The instrumental track **Interstate Epitaph** includes an interesting midpoint break with what almost sounds like cars passing by. The following track **Infestation** builds the weight again, with the final track a great combination of speed and deep vocals that almost border on 90s punk (but still very much metal). I’m not musically trained; just someone who knows what he likes. Having experienced secular 90s metal as it unfolded (with a healthy dose of industrial on the side), this album has been in heavy rotation for me over the past week. Definitely excited for future releases!

**Favorite tracks:** The entire album. Short enough to enjoy in a single sitting.
