> "ZHAKIAH is a concept started by composer Jani Stefanovic who ́s known from bands such as Solution.45, Miseration to mention a few.
> 
> Zhakiah delivers Melodic death metal with hints to his roots in the infamous Gothenburg sound but with some minor updated touches. Zhakiah is certainly not reinventing the wheel but delivers Melodic death metal with a good mixture of aggressive thrash and double-bass drumming with beautiful melancholic melodies and heavy groovy elements."
