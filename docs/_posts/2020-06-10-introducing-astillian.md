Born from Chicago melodic metal veterans(_Mike & Dan Gleason_ of _**[Afterimage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA6UWU_evJM)**_), _**Âstillian**_ began to cast a vision for the Dark Age inspired metal project in late 2016\. Their debut album, _**Waves at Dusk**_, is a concept album inspired by _G.K. Chesterton’s, “The Ballad of the White Horse_."

Uphold the honor, the sacred task Spread upon the barren world Standing on the edge of a blade We will take it and see it through

I have wielded the hammer, the wrath of God Against the distant foe I have spoken forth the twilight end Of those who venture near I have called upon my fellow souls To draw from strength within I have lit the torch of heaven's light To gaze the angel's path

Cloudburst skies above Fall upon blissful shores In the wind, a hymn of doom Foreboding a nightmare war

Uphold the honor, the sacred task Spread upon the barren world Standing on the edge of a blade We will take it and see it through

I have sailed to hell, inhaled the fire And turned to breathe it back I have persevered against the trial And never turned away I have beckoned every nation to see Triumph bestowed on us I will wear the crown, given by God And command these mighty men

Cloudburst skies above Fall upon blissful shores In the wind, a hymn of doom Foreboding a nightmare war

Continue the old ways And leave behind old gods Take up the sword and shield and spear Scream out the hallowed song

See the ever dimming saga of our time The horde of murderous men and justice laid low The reign of the chosen soul to redeem The rising of the sovereign, righteous king
