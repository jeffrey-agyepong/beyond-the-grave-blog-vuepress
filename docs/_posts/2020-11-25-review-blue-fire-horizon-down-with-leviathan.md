**Blue Fire Horizon** is a Christian Metalcore band, with many influences from different musical genres, like Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, Deathcore, and Melodic Hardcore.

It's amazing to see how these guys joined to make such an amazing EP as an independent release. This is an EP that is just fun to listen to, there is no way you get bored while listening to it, every song is pretty different from the other and adds a new texture to the album which keeps it, fresh, original, innovative, and most of all intriguing. It catches your total attention since the first songs hits.

I'd like to highlight the control and balance of heaviness this band performs, setting in a pretty diverse sound that always stays interesting, taking some elements from Alternative Metal, Post-Grunge, and even some Nu-Metal vibes, but also throwing really brutal stuff at you, especially at breakdowns, that touch and equal the heaviness of a Deathcore Breakdown. I feel it’s tough to compare this band with other bands, because of its unique sound, but secular bands like **Seether** (the Post-Grunge vibes instantly reminded me of it), **Three Days Grace** and **Breaking Benjamin**, and Christian bands like **Decyfer Down** and **Disciple** reflect its Alternative Metal side, while at their heavier/Metalcore side, they reminded me of Christian bands like **Demon Hunter**, **Embodyment**, **Forfeit Thee Untrue**, **XIII Minutes, Convictions, War of Ages** and **Diamonds to Dust**, and secular acts like Of Mice And Men would get close to what this band sounds like, but I still think it doesn’t do justice to them. For me, BFH is just comparable with themselves.

The album starts with **The War Is Everything** which evokes the more characteristic style from this band yet. The song starts with an interesting electric ambient vibe, and some Post-Grunge vibes thanks to the guitar riffs and the cleans of the vocalist (which I found really top tier for the scene), but then it hits harder with some Metalcore riffs, not going too far from the Alternative vibe, but adding aggressiveness on the drum grooves, and the harsh vocals, that are composed by awesome low growls and filthy high screams. The vocalist also performs long fry screams, which were pretty cool and well-executed. This song puts you in the mood and gives you a correct and logical entry to the awesome album you’re about to experience. **Made To Suffer** starts heavier, with beautifully executed Melodic Metalcore-like riffs, and more intensity, till the cover starts with a great clean melody that softens a bit the ambiance but enriches the sound. Songs like these are needed in today’s Metalcore scene. I want to add that the Breakdown of this song is **MASSIVE** and they display excellent use of **cowbell** and well-done production. Breakdowns like these made me think of **Diamonds To Dust** and the success they’ve got because of their breakdowns. The same thing should happen with this band, this is a Deathcore breakdown masterfully incorporated into a Metalcore song. The exact opposite of boring. Both songs have great encouraging lyrics that talk about the battle, the spiritual war that we face every day, being anthems for those who feel worn-out. We can’t give up, we got to fight this fight, our strength should come from the Lord and we will be victorious, but we gotta be prepared because the war is rough.

The second part of this album starts with **Prosperity**, a song against “Prosperity Gospel”, attacking these false preaching that wants to put the name of the Lord to shame, to get richer. The lyrics speak for themselves (I´m loving this). Musically this was a really fun song to listen to, full of Melodic Hardcore vibes, like gang shouts and awesome bass lines (if the bassist reads this, I'd like to congratulate you, because you killed it on this song) that are very uplifting, also adding a Nu-Metal kind of feel on it. You can almost touch the **Disciple** influences on this song, which was pretty entertaining and refreshing. I’m not sure how I feel about the electronic part, but it was very interesting. This song also has a great solo, by the way, pretty well executed. **Blood Of The Innocent** is by far my favorite song from the whole EP, starting with awesome symphonic elements that I wasn’t expecting. They took me by surprise. Melody, vocals, riffs, drums, everything is amazing in this song. But the lyrics, against abortion, were the most powerful element from this song, this is a highly controversial topic, yes, but we, as CHURCH have to stand against this atrocity, we can’t let this happen, that’s why these lyrics touched me deep in the heart. **Down With Leviathan** is a great way to finish the record, and it is pretty interesting because it directly starts with a potent breakdown followed by technical riffs. It has an acoustic/ambient interlude that increases and escalates energy till the last Breakdown, which is a NECKBREAKER by all means. Fantastic, and lyrics bring the perfect end to the album, exalting the Glory and Power of God, who gave us the power to destroy Leviathan.

This is a crazily good EP for a debut album, I’m extremely excited for what this band can become in the future, if they received more recognition and get a label that fully understands their vision this band could turn pretty influential and big for the current Metalcore scene, because of their creativity and versatile sound. Extremely talented guys! God bless them!
