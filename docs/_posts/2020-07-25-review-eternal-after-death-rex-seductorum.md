**Eternal After Death** is a Brutal Deathcore band hailing from Brazil. They are signed to Insanity Death Records.

**Lyrically:** The lyrics of this album stand firmly on Scripture. Addressing religious hypocrisy, exposing Satan for his deceptive intents, and giving a look at the discipline of God while declaring His ultimate majesty, the lyrics of this album are sure to move your heart and mind.

**Sonically:** This is honestly one of the best Deathcore albums I've heard in a while. I just love the distorted high shrieks layering with the deeper growling, The instruments are heavy and slow rolling (in that smooth Deathcore kind of way), and beautiful orchestras can be heard in the album-opening a doorway to the suspense factor. Listen, if you like Deathcore then trust me when I say that this album stays true to its classic dark and heavy sound. The band utilizes inhale vocals so that might be a turn off for some listeners.

**Favorite tracks:** Alma Dilacerada and Inimigo No Espelho

**Alma Dilacerada:** Opens with the soft whirling of guitars and a haunting drift of soft vocals sending you in a trance until the epic chaos erupts. The drums sound particularly amazing on this track as well. **Inimigo No Espelho:** Howling wind and more soft vocals introduce us to this chaotic track. I'm not entirely sure, but I might hear some Slam elements in certain parts of this song. A stompingly distinguished track.

**Overall:** This album is a raging, powerful display of Brutal Deathcore. Listen, and you will not be disappointed.

**(Translation of Portuguese lyrics)**

Manipulating the masses His ignorance cost his own redemption

Look at me, I’m the one who threw you into misery! Infecting your mind I can manipulate you Showing religious hypocrisy disguised by false love Disguised by a false love Disguised by a false love

I am the false king, I am here to kill, steal and destroy Blinding your vision, distorting the scriptures, I plan to destroy you (2x)

I am the false king, but my minions go my way I am the king of torment, of all pain and of all its suffering

Lacerated bodies build my kingdom of destruction Controlling those with shaken faith I build my ascension

Controlling your soul with my hands Putting all hate in your heart

“In what time have you been According to the course of this world, According to the prince of the powers of the air, Of the Spirit that now works in the children of disobedience “

(Ephesians 2: 2)

I am the false king, but my minions go my way I am the king of torment, of all pain and all its suffering
