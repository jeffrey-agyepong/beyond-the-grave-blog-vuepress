The Failed Sun is the fifth full-length album from Sombre Holiday, and although the content is specifically tied to its predecessor, The Sea of Distance, the new album stands on its own. Containing twelve new songs that give the response to the despair of The Sea of Distance, The Failed Sun delivers a solid punch of aggressive prog metal. While leaning more heavily towards a classic heavy metal sound, The Failed Sun reveals the power of hope in a unique way.

A book-ended album, Sombre Holiday's latest offering builds on and adapts its musical themes around its lyrical content, allowing the listener to develop new insights through diverse musical experiences. Where the previous album (The Sea of Distance) focused on the brokenness of all relationships, whether with God or with people, The Failed Sun promotes the potential power of restoration in all relationships.

Using a blend of guitars, keyboards, drums, and violin, The Failed Sun is 70 minutes of intense, soul-wrestling and deep contemplation—the largest offering from Sombre Holiday thus far—a powerful melodic metal journey.
