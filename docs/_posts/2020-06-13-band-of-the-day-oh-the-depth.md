> **_"Bring Me to Death"_**
> 
> _You think you're good?_ _You think you got it?_ _You're just as blind as the ones that condemn_ _So bring down all your religion_ _And toss it in the flame_
> 
> _Bring us to death_
> 
> _How long will we try to be made perfect by the flesh?_ _How long will we live as fools?_ _Even in our ignorance He anchors down the soul_ _We are kept in an inheritance that's incorruptible_
> 
> _This leaves us with no regrets_ _But the sorrow of the world works dead_ _Now is the time to respond to His favor_
> 
> _From birth we are sin_ _But reborn we are one_
> 
> _I am but rotting flesh_ _I put my faith in the One who raises the dead_
> 
> _Let this cross do its work in me_ _Bringing death so I can be set free_ _Free from myself, not just some enemy_ _So I cry out, "Oh God reveal Thy Son in me"_ _Let this cross do its work in me_ _Bringing death so I can be set free_ _Free from myself, not just some enemy_ _So I cry out, "Oh God reveal Thy Son in me"_
> 
> _We're all dead_ _We just don't know it yet_ _We say He governs our life_ _as we sit on the throne_
> 
> _Self is the only prison that can bind the soul_ _We are handed over to demise to gain resurrection through our humanity_
> 
> _What more can you add to perfection?_ _He desires to unveil the heart to an unveiled salvation_ _There is nothing more to gain, just to know the Lamb_ _That killed the old nature_
> 
> _Can we come to an end where we're not longer in view_ _Just the one that is Holy Perfect and all of truth_ _I will not conform to what seems right to a man_ _But renewed in this mind of mine_
> 
> _Bring us to death_ _Bring us to death_
> 
> _I crave for all that is mortal to be swallowed up by eternal life_ _By eternal life_
> 
> _Bring us to death_

> _I realize now I’m my own worst enemy_
> 
> Here we go again Where the waves come crashing down on this house of mine Lies inside fueled by fear and being fanned by pride I cannot deny So full of me, an empty hole Promoting thoughts of turning back So sick of me, oh so sick of me I just can’t go back, no I can’t turn back Hard to see how truth can break me free Do I choose injustice or choose His nail-scarred feet Oh the battle of my aching soul I realize now I’m my own worst enemy When will I decrease Come reign oh Prince of Peace Your love remains as the seasons change This is my true heart cry As I scream to the sky
> 
> I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
> 
> Take me by the hand Pull me out of this darkness Bring me to your ways Teach me how to rid this hate I am but a man Who lives inside of his own head Imprisoned by his memories I am my own worst enemy
> 
> Now I see how truth will set me free Why choose injustice When all I see is You in me Clear the smoke screens that blind my heart Take me to His nature something I cannot do When will I decrease Come reign oh Prince of Peace Your love remains as the seasons change Use this valley of death for my own good
> 
> “I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the Earth, whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O Lord my God, snatched me from the jaws of death!” _When will I decrease Come reign oh Prince of Peace_ _When will I decrease Come reign oh Prince of Peace_
