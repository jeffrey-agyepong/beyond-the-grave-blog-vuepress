> “Horeb” is a short, heavy, melancholic, dramatic and sometimes foreign sounding concept album about the biblical figure Elijah. Big lyrical themes are suicidal thoughts, depression and an unexplainable, transcending and epic encounter with a cosmic, almighty God. Sound wise it contains complex odd-meters and some experimental native instruments, but it still keeps a headband worthy groove and sometimes even an impressive speed.

> “He toys with the meter like a puppet master pulling the strings on his subject. (…) He’s weaved a web of multi-faceted layers of Technical and Progressive sounds with dark, angry vocals, and a touch of the unconventional with those Middle Eastern influences. Those hearty accents and vocals that give off an air of vulnerability are truly unique. They remind me of a few bands in the Progressive Death Metal genre but what he has created here is his alone. If you are a fan of the genre, definitely pick this up.” - Metal Temple

> “With short intros added to the beginning of most tracks, atmospheric elements incorporated in the middle of certain tracks, acoustic elements woven in sporadically as well as spoken word moments mixed in, Theoptia does a great job of providing you with unique and varied sounds. There isn’t one song that sounds like another on this record as Theoptia provides you with plenty of variation all throughout Horeb” - Cadaver Garden
