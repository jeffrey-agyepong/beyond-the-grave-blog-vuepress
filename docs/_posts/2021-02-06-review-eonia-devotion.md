Eonia is a melodic metalcore band from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and, to my knowledge at least, it only consists of Gabriel Smith right now. With Kenny Flores featuring as a vocalist on two tracks. 

**Sound and Mixing**: The production quality of this EP is some of the best I have heard in a long while. Everything is very crisp, clear, and has a chance to shine. The guitars are what drive **Devotion** forward almost entirely. However, the drums, while simple, really do get the job done and you would be hard-pressed to find something wrong with how everything sounds here, especially since this is one person making music. The vocals, when there are lyrics in songs (we will get to that shortly), are clear and easy to understand, while sounding raw. Almost as if the lyrics were being sung to you while you were in the same room.

**Lyrics**: Now for the interesting part of this EP. There are exactly two songs with lyrics involved on this EP! “Mind Above, Spirit Within,” and “Promise to Reflect,” are the songs and they really do stand out. It should also be noted that these are the shortest songs on the EP, so this really is a musically driven experience. When there are lyrics, the themes vary with topics of looking for something more in life or being meant for something greater. “Promise to Reflect,” deals with just that: reflection. The main focus that I could gather is reflecting on the world around us and how it changes. I think that each listener is going to get something different out of these two songs, so I don’t want to give too much away here.

**Final Thoughts and Rating**: **Eonia** is definitely an act to be on the lookout for in the future. The technical skill that went into **Devotion** alone makes me genuinely excited to see what else comes out of this project.

**Reason**: The only thing that keeps this EP from being higher is the fact that there are not a lot of lyrics to think about or chew on. This is definitely a cool EP and shouldn’t be missed. Especially by those that love bands that focus more on instruments than vocals.
