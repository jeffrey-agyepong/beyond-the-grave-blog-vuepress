You might have known them back when they were Face The Throne(disbanded), this is the first recording of their album Ephemera with their original vocalist Mark and to be honest, I like his vocals more than the guy who replaced him. Also, this album is available for "Name Your Price" so you don't want to sleep on this.

Genre: Metalcore/deathcore FFO: Face The Throne, For Today, Saving Grace

Bandcamp: Here(Free/Name Your Price) Facebook: Grace Notes
