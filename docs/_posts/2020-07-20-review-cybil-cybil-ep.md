The man behind **Cybil** has a powerful testimony: "I got my life together and had my son. Shortly after, my world kind of fell apart. Fell into a deep depression. When I wasn't with my son, I would drink. Drank myself into suicidal thoughts, destructive behavior, and misery. I was on the verge of killing myself. If I didn't do it, the alcohol would. Then one day, my son got sick, and I took him to the hospital. After he went home with his mom and when I went home, I immediately opened a beer and started to drink, when I felt God tell me "you are a full-time father whether he's with you or not" I poured out that beer, trashed the rest and cried all night. After that, I quit drinking and never touched it or even thought of it again. I filled my time and bad habits by picking up the guitar again and reigniting a passion for it. God and music saved my life." Thus **Cybil** was made. This American Metal project has a lot to share with us all.

**Lyrically:** With lyrics fueled with hatred towards corruption and evil, one will feel the lyricist's passion for what he believes in.

**Sonically:** This was a good listen. Cybil unleashes a fantastic barrage of Metal using melodic riffs to create an environment of audio to make the listener feel at home. The vocals are deep, balanced, and well-executed. With the sharpened skill of all the instruments that are used in this EP, Cybil rises, worthy to be heard. It's also worth noting that the audio quality is rather raw.

**Favorite tracks:** Dark Heart and The Distance Between.

**Dark Heart** starts with deep ethereal sounding vocals to welcome the fantastic vortex of organized chaos that awaits.

**The Distance Between Us** starts with a stomp worthy riff, then drums that are precisely played. This one is a banger for sure.

**Overall:** I believe that Cybil has a good future in the Metal community. You can tell that a lot and time was put into this EP. I will be looking forward to what Cybil offers us in the future.
