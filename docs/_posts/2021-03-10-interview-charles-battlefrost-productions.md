Battlefrost Productions is a new independent metal record label founded by musician and producer Charles Powell. Charles recently remixed and remastered Tortured Conscience's [Every Knee Shall Bow](https://www.beyondthegravemusic.com/2020/11/18/review-tortured-conscience-every-knee-shall-bow-remixed-remastered/) and I asked him some questions regarding the process, the vision of Battlefrost Productions, his band Sylvan Fortress (including members of Antestor & Crimson Thorn), and his upcoming book on Christian metal.
