This Is Our Worship: Volume III was put together with YOU in mind. We pray this album provides encouragement, hope, and love in Jesus' name. Our main theme is built around worship, but that comes in many forms. While we have worship songs in the traditional sense, we acknowledge that we live our lives in worship to the King of Kings.

The track list was intentionally laid out as a smooth, cohesive listening experience (to the best of my abilities). We kick off with the beautiful opener "Genesis" from the band Rise, My King. From the moment I was in contact with the band, I knew this had to be the intro to the whole album. You will notice times where the tone changes into a more dark and deep messages of struggle, but every time we turn it around with songs of hope or praise to Jesus. I feel like this is a natural interpretation of the Christian life. The album closes off in a cover of the song "Forever" originally by Kari Jobe, performed now by Poieo. I felt this was a suiting way to close the album and leave us off proclaiming "Forever, He is glorified. Forever, He is lifted high. Forever, He is risen. He is alive."

This Is Our Worship: Volume III is built from bands from all over the world, with a diversity in genres, and with this many people involved, many different types of believers. This is the disclaimer that you may not agree with everything said on the album, maybe not every single band member may even call themselves a Christian. Our goal was to put together an album that points the world to Jesus, it can be used as a tool to evangelize, or just as an album to sit and bang your head to. Either way we pray you get something out of this.

With all of that being said, please share this album with anyone you know who does like metal. Also consider sharing it with a couple people who may not. The album is a free gift, from all of the artists involved. Share to help them out, they deserve more attention and support than they get from the music industry or fans at large. we go from Rock to (un)Black Metal in this compilation, there is literally something for anyone who likes alternative music. And best of all, think of all who could hear this and come to know the Lord because of it, there is so much potential, with these many artists involved.

Any donations made will be used to further God's Kingdom through the ministry of Christian Metal Source or through our partners, For The Rock, Christian Music Library, and Christian Metal Promotion.
