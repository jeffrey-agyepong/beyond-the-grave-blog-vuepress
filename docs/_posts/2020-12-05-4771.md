It was the little things that left me wondering

You won me over at the start We grew together, heart to heart But there were little things That left me wondering

Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you need me to go and change myself? Did you want me to be somebody else?

What did you want me to be?

Go on and tell me about me How I should act, how I should think When I should catch my own feelings It's all the little things And every time you cut me out I had these doubts And I've tried to push 'em down But now I've found that it's hard To not believe these little things That have left me wondering

Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you need me to go and change myself? Did you want me to be somebody else?

What did you want me to be?

Since when did you define me? And when did you design me? How long have you reviled me? I've had enough

It was the little things that left me wondering I still believe A dream about who I wish we could be

Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you want me to be somebody else? Did you need me to go and change myself? Did you want me to be somebody else?

Did you want me to be somebody else?

When I finally decide to protect myself I'll be putting what we had on the shelf Or just maybe you'll make me knock it down Dashing all of our memories to the ground If you need me to go and change myself Even down to the things I just can't help If you want me to be somebody else Maybe I should be first to say farewell
