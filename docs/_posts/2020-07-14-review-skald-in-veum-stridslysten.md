Hailing from Sweden, this Scandinavian Unblack Metal band unleashes carnage and faith upon all those who listen to them. **Skald En Veum** formed in 2013 and is still going strong to this day. _Mund (vocals), Resh (guitars, drums), Zhajiin (guitars, bass), and Heth (who they look to as a spiritual leader and ideologist)_ serve their Lord through the talents that He has given them. Their current label is _Rottweiler Records_. **Stridsylsten** was released on April 12th of 2019. It is their 2nd studio album. The Swedish word, **_Stridsylsten_** means " _combative_ " which is a perfect way to describe this album. The album was released on _Rottweiler Records_ and _Nordic Mission_. Prepare for war!

**Lyrically:** Yes this is indeed battle music. The lyrics stand firm in the fact that God is loving and will someday bring complete justice upon Satan. At one point in the title track, the lyricist proclaims; **_"Truth does not fear death cause Truth will never die. Truth has become a torch and an ax, In my hand to cut down Yggdrasil and set the world ablaze."_** The album goes on lyrically declaring war upon evil forces and declaring that God is the king of all.

**Sonically:** I must say the drumming on this album is fantastic. The growling vocals are well executed as well as the clean vocals that can sometimes be heard on certain parts. The riffs are searingly fast providing a sense of organized chaos for the listener to be engulfed in. I honestly think that even Satanic Black Metal fans can find something to appreciate in the sound of this album. It has the kvlt sound without being kvlt in their lyrics.

**Favorite Tracks:** En Lyra Dopt I Blod and Shards of the Infernal Fall.

**Stridslysten:** The album starts with the sound of a sword (the Word of God) being unsheathed, a sound that invites you to look into your soul and allow God to desecrate the things that are bad within you. As frantic riffs and blast beats pour into your ears you instantly take notice of Mund's icy agonized vocals unleashing the power of the lyrics.

**Overall:** This is a great ride of an album. They truly nailed the agonized Black Metal vocals as well as the swarming riffs. A must-listen for any fan of Black Metal.
