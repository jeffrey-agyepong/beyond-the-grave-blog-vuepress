Dredge the depths of hell with shovel and hand, But you can never conceal the truth.

Build your temple as high as you can, But you will never contain our spiritual youth.

Sever the limbs that inquest your throne, Breaking the bones of your own body.

Curse the earth for yielding only her stone.

Bandage the carcass of an archaic donkey.

When you preach, I hear a choir of conceited worms crawling out from the abyss,

To create a kingdom of wealth for themselves.

So raise the banner of, False security adhered by a thread,

Under the flag that we pledge our allegiance.

Feed the effigies inside of our heads, To numb our contempt for our appearances.

Destroy the foreign horde with guided rockets.

You mediate the earth with a selfish fist. Bow to the god that fills your wallet.

God bless America, survival of the richest.

But as the walls of our church dissolve, we hear the cries that were made silent,

And as the confines of our souls evolve,

witness the collapse of the red giant. We are isolated in eisegesis.

Usher in the abolition of the paramnesia event horizon.

We’re isolated in eisegesis.

All our fears will be laid to rest in the great expanse of the void’s regress.
