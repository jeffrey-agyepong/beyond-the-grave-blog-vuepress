North Carolina metalcore band, [The Worshiper](https://www.facebook.com/TheWorshiperBand/), have made their 2016 EP "Reveal Us" available for FREE.

> The Worshiper is a 4 piece band from Jefferson, NC. The band has many elements that consist of sharp riffs, sing-alongchoruses, and breakdowns. They write hoping to acquire the taste of anyone who loves music, and to anyone that finds themselves broken. Each member plays a key role in the music created by the band. The Worshiper spreads a message of love influenced by faith within their music.

_FFO: Oh, Sleeper, Phinehas, Fit For A King, August Burns Red, and For Today_
