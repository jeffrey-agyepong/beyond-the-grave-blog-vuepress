Contentment, oh so rare A fine jewel obscure to man A treasure buried underneath Our many possessions

Its quite tiresome you know To find the key, to find the fix I traveled to, I traveled through To find the key, to find the fix

I did what every one else did Set my mind on vanity Spent my pay on luxury But "luxury is artificial poverty"

We sit at the banquet table Meals served like we're kings and queens Yet all we ingest is a plate of envy We sit at the banquet table Meals served like we're kings and queens Starving for a taste of whats across from me

Is it ever enough? Is it in my head? is it in my blood?

I ran out of room I couldn't find the space for ease I bought what they sold Consume consume, I'm consumed

Exhausting myself, I spin on an endless loop "When I have this then I'll be happy When I have that then I'll be savvy"

We sit at the banquet table Meals served like we're kings and queens Yet all we ingest is a plate of envy We sit at the banquet table Meals served like we're kings and queens Starving for a taste of whats across from me

An accumulation of assets But still a groaning in our stomaches Who knew vacuity inside would be so heavy

But may we strive for a greater gain Free from the burden of silver A perspective that is rich and worth The weight of gold

I will be wealthy not in what I own But in what I can do with out

Contentment, oh so rare A fine jewel obscure to man A treasure buried underneath possessions
