[Timōrātus](https://timoratus.bandcamp.com/music) is an experimental metal or ‘Multi-genre metal' band as they like to call them themselves. Their new album **My Life in a Mediocre Metal Band** covers a wide variety of genres, including; black metal, death metal, progressive metalcore(djent), hip hop, with an electronic influence throughout. This album is a peek behind the curtains of your every day “mediocre” metal band and expresses the struggles, joys, and aspirations that come with it, in a satirical manner. The album comprises of seven songs and three interludes/sketches.

**Lyrically:** Alright, so I have never been in a Metal band but I know that people who have had that experience for a while will deeply enjoy the lyrics of this album. The lyrics describe the experience of being in a Metal band in a light-hearted comedic attitude.

> Are we there yet Cause my butt is starting to fall asleep Are we there yet This van is a loud broken down junk heap Are we there yet Somebody really needs to take a shower Are we there yet This cramped can is starting to smell really sour - Are We There Yet?(Track 2)

**Sonically:** A lot of Metalheads might dislike some aspects of this album because it tends to lean a bit towards more electronic sounds. I think the band did a wonderful job of incorporating such elements in the sound of Metal. To me, the electronic parts of the album provide a haunting blanket of atmosphere. David and Courtney Napier are amazing vocalists. David provides low Black Metal-Esque growling ( and melodic clean vocals ) and Courtney unleashes a savage demonstration of growling. The vocals in this album prove that even if the lyrics can be a little bit humorous if you are a good vocalist you can make any lyrics sound awesome and captivating!

**Favorite tracks:** Are We There Yet? and Chasing Trends.

**Overall:** I'm very pleased with this album. I think that if you have someone curious about Metal, this is the perfect album for them. Nicely executed tracks.

#### <h2 style="text-align:center;">BTG Alternative Opinion</h2>

**Lyrically** the album is entertaining. As a metal enthusiast, some lyrics are very relatable. They're very creative and clever, taking the theme into account. Through the decades, metal has seemed to become synonymous with being stone cold, so it's refreshing to see a band take a laid back approach for a change.

The musicianship of TIMŌRĀTUS is obvious, with their ability to play a wide variety of genres and pull it off. However, the underlining electronic influence can be a bit distracting at times, especially on the first listen. Vocally, David Napier and his wife Courtney nicely complement each other. David offers low death metal growls and Courtney, high screams. Admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of Courtney's screaming (hardcore punk-ish) but she has a good technique. There are also guest vocal spots from Logan "The Redneck" Thompson and Mason "The Kid" Beard. Alongside the vocal work, guitars are especially stellar, very crisp, heavy, and there are some hard-hitting riffs along with a couple of solos. The bass stands out in some songs and has a good tone. There are some brutal breakdowns as well.

**Overall**, this is a solid and unique album. I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to explore the metal genre. It's something different, entertaining, and the subject is realistic in the current metal scene. It's very cohesive, so this album is best listened to as a whole, instead of standalone tracks. The only setback for me was the style of electronica they used, a little overbearing at times but if you don't mind it, you'll thoroughly enjoy this record.

**Favorite tracks:** Chasing Trends, Creative Control, Christmas Present Chaos

Can I get a hot minute thinkin’ ’bout The Kid Sittin' at the drums ‘bout to make me crazy What would he like to opening on Christmas day Hoping he likes what I get him either way I know that Halo is his favorite gaming FPS Crushing those noobs brings him joy in great excess He may be young and lacking in experience But he's a cool dude despite his clumsiness

Bright lights and the Cheeto dust settles He loves to bring life to all that old metal Late nights and empty soda cans Partied so long he passed out in the van What could he use to cut loose Here's a pop quiz Maybe some cheese whiz What do I get the party guy What do I buy to make him more fly

Place it in a box Tape it all around It’s not like it’s smallpox This should be my playground Complicated Exhilarated Anticipated Nauseated Can’t seem to find the right thing For my friend the drum machine

Style Fashion Trendsetter Rocks that microphone Step to the side Break it all down I'm sure there's something clothes related I can get for her wardrobe

Gotta grind it out Make it loud Crank it up Deer themed underwear Gun related socks What could I get to take hunting I know what I can do I know what I can get Craft supplies and some paper clips Gonna MacGyver something good That he’ll never forget

It’s all doom Light is all gone Missed my window To get them something on Amazon

Why, why is it so hard to buy a gift For a teen with some sick skill I don’t want him to think I forgot Every year it’s something new Just a matter of which who I could get him a decal that says “bands without drummers suck”

He’s a good brother and a friend What could he use to see him through the bitter end We’re at the age of practicality But it must reek of brutality
