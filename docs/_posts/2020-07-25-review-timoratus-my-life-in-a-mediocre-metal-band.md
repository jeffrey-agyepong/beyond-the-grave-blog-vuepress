[Timōrātus](https://timoratus.bandcamp.com/music) is an experimental metal or ‘Multi-genre metal' band as they like to call them themselves. Their new album **My Life in a Mediocre Metal Band** covers a wide variety of genres, including; black metal, death metal, progressive metalcore(djent), hip hop, with an electronic influence throughout. This album is a peek behind the curtains of your every day “mediocre” metal band and expresses the struggles, joys, and aspirations that come with it, in a satirical manner. The album comprises of seven songs and three interludes/sketches.

**Lyrically:** Alright, so I have never been in a Metal band but I know that people who have had that experience for a while will deeply enjoy the lyrics of this album. The lyrics describe the experience of being in a Metal band in a light-hearted comedic attitude.

> Are we there yet Cause my butt is starting to fall asleep Are we there yet This van is a loud broken down junk heap Are we there yet Somebody really needs to take a shower Are we there yet This cramped can is starting to smell really sour - Are We There Yet?(Track 2)

**Sonically:** A lot of Metalheads might dislike some aspects of this album because it tends to lean a bit towards more electronic sounds. I think the band did a wonderful job of incorporating such elements in the sound of Metal. To me, the electronic parts of the album provide a haunting blanket of atmosphere. David and Courtney Napier are amazing vocalists. David provides low Black Metal-Esque growling ( and melodic clean vocals ) and Courtney unleashes a savage demonstration of growling. The vocals in this album prove that even if the lyrics can be a little bit humorous if you are a good vocalist you can make any lyrics sound awesome and captivating!

**Favorite tracks:** Are We There Yet? and Chasing Trends.

**Overall:** I'm very pleased with this album. I think that if you have someone curious about Metal, this is the perfect album for them. Nicely executed tracks.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">BTG Alternative Opinion</h2>

**Lyrically** the album is entertaining. As a metal enthusiast, some lyrics are very relatable. They're very creative and clever, taking the theme into account. Through the decades, metal has seemed to become synonymous with being stone cold, so it's refreshing to see a band take a laid back approach for a change.

The musicianship of TIMŌRĀTUS is obvious, with their ability to play a wide variety of genres and pull it off. However, the underlining electronic influence can be a bit distracting at times, especially on the first listen. Vocally, David Napier and his wife Courtney nicely complement each other. David offers low death metal growls and Courtney, high screams. Admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of Courtney's screaming (hardcore punk-ish) but she has a good technique. There are also guest vocal spots from Logan "The Redneck" Thompson and Mason "The Kid" Beard. Alongside the vocal work, guitars are especially stellar, very crisp, heavy, and there are some hard-hitting riffs along with a couple of solos. The bass stands out in some songs and has a good tone. There are some brutal breakdowns as well.

**Overall**, this is a solid and unique album. I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to explore the metal genre. It's something different, entertaining, and the subject is realistic in the current metal scene. It's very cohesive, so this album is best listened to as a whole, instead of standalone tracks. The only setback for me was the style of electronica they used, a little overbearing at times but if you don't mind it, you'll thoroughly enjoy this record.
