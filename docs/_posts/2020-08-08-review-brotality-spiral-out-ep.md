**Band:** Brotality

**EP:** Spiral Out

**Record Label:** Rottweiler Records

**Release Date:** July 3, 2020

**EP length:** 10 Minutes

**Genre:** Heavy Metal

**_Brotality_** is a heavy metal band from Narrowsburg, New York(USA) formed by two brothers Bryce Maopolski (17, guitar and vocals) and Reece Maopolski (16, bass, and vocals), along with their friend Liam Fenton (14, drums) have created a band that unapologetically takes its sonic cues straight from the founding fathers of metal. With tight songwriting, muscular vocals, and crushing riffs in abundance, Brotality has created a dynamic force worthy of carrying forward the Heavy Metal. They are signed to _Rottweiler Records_ and **Spiral Out** was released on July 3rd of 2020.

**Lyrically:** The song is about negativity, and we should combat it with compassion. Ultimately, only Christ can rid us of our negative if we turn to Him in repentance and faith.

**Sonically:** This is a good listen. It starts with slick guitar work leading to the thrashy chaos that lies ahead. The vocal melodies are well executed and go well with the instrumentals. With dizzying riffs and savage drums, I think the band did a great job turning the word " spiral " into a sound.

**Overall:** I was impressed with how good this track sounded. I do however wish there was more story to the lyrics. With that said this young band has a bright future ahead of them.

**Salting the Wound** was released through Rottweiler Records on July 3rd, 2020.

**Lyrically:** The lyrics can comfort the listener because they talk about how difficult life can be sometimes, " I wish I had the way out, life has anchors that weigh me down. " The song declares that God is the ultimate comforter.

**Sonically:** Really, this song is impressive also. You can tell that they take Metal seriously with their headbang worthy riffs, rough Thrash Metal inspired vocals and overall atmosphere that they achieve through their instrument writing.

**Overall:** This was a good listening experience. The band has proved themselves worthy to be heard. There is just enough dynamic in the instruments to make it listenable, and the vocals are well executed.
