**We Are Victory** is a Hardcore band from Nashville, TN. They are signed to Sancrosanct Records. The members of the band are; Jay Latham - Lead Vocals, Bobby Joe Witt - Guitar, Lael Joubert - Bass, and Jason Henderson - Drums

**Words Won't Define** is their second single since the release of their sophomore album "[Sirens](https://wearevictory1.bandcamp.com/releases)". I'm writing this on 7/18/2020 so the music video has not released yet, but trust me, I'm excited about it.

**Lyrically:** Words Won't Define is perfect for a Christian who is facing verbal opposition for his faith. The song gives mention to the emotional struggle that can be felt in this situation while standing firm because they will not give up their faith no matter what anyone says. This song is perfect for any Christian dealing with persecution or loneliness because of it.

**Sonically:** This song is a kicker, it instantly rolls into the action and serves up melodic riffs, steady drums, a landslide of savage screaming vocals, leading into a breakdown where a more electronic element can be heard. Soaring clean vocals can also be heard in the song, which in my opinion works very well with the screaming vocals.

**Overall:** We Are Victory has proved themselves to be a force to be reckoned with, with this stomp worthy single. I'm very excited to see what We Are Victory has to offer us in the future.
