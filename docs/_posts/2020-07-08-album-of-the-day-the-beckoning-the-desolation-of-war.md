Lord, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for mercy; in your faithfulness and righteousness come to my relief. Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you. The enemy pursues me, he crushes me to the ground; he makes me dwell in the darkness like those long dead. (Psalm 143:1-4)

I see the lies blinding eyes forsaking truth for compromise blind lead the blind as love grows cold their calloused hearts lay waste their souls in an age of dire vision hope is wearing thin fallen angels spread their wings boasting in their sin thirsting for light in a barren land searching the night for some hope clinging to lies of the serpent who wages his war on my soul the love of many will grow cold I must not forget that this is war Ember inside is dying this path of suffering is blinding in an age of dire vision hope is wearing thin fallen angels spread their wings boasting in their sin thirsting for light in a barren land searching the night for some hope clinging to lies of the serpent who wages his war on my soul the love of many will grow cold I must not forget that this is war Fire - faith refined Fire - faith refined Fire - Christ is my Fire - Piece of mind
