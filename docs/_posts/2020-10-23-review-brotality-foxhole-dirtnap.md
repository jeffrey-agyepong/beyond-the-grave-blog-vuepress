**Record Label:** Rottweiler Records

**Release Date:** October 16, 2020

**EP length:** 9 Minutes

**Genre:** Thrash Metal

**Brotality** is an old school Thrash Metal band new to the scene. Their members are Bryce (guitar and vocals ), Reece (bass and vocals), and Liam (drums and vocals). **Foxhole** was released through Rottweiler Records on October 16, 2020.

**Lyrically:** Foxhole addresses the people who are in a closed-minded and stubborn state.

> "Close Minded, you're reluctant to change, Stay away, In absence of a life with meaning, There's nothing wrong ".

The song then declares for people to follow the Truth and find meaning. The lyricist wields this meaningful message for all to hear.

**Sonically:** Foxhole immediately lunges into action with slamming drums and fury filled riffs. The vocals go from a rough edge to a cleaner sound throughout the song, The vocal melodies are sharp and glide well with the instruments (though I wish there was a bit more variety in tones). There is also a really cool guitar solo.

**Overall:** Though this band is new to the scene, Brotality once again shows that they have what it takes. The song is very listenable and has depth (in heaviness and emotion).

**Dirtnap** was released on October 16, 2020, through **Rottweiler Records**.

**Lyrically:** _Dirtnap_ seems to be told through the perspective of a person watching a loved one's health decline. The lyrics to this song are deeply poetic, expressing feelings of sorrow and concern;

> " Will we meet again, Score the sky in the dark, Closure at the heart, Find your rest in His hands, With you I stand, Life in hell ".

The story of this song definitely is powerful.

**Sonically:** Dirtnap starts with a smooth drum solo, then rolls with catchy guitar work. I really like how the drums are placed in this song. The spiraling riffs work to create an imaginative ground for the listener, as well as the vocals that range from balanced, clean singing to a more gruff tone.

**Overall:** Brotality has continued to show that they have a solid ground in the scene. I can easily see people moshing to this song being played live. Well done.
