Manipulating the masses His ignorance cost his own redemption

Look at me, I'm the one who threw you into misery! Infecting your mind I can manipulate you Showing religious hypocrisy disguised by false love Disguised by a false love Disguised by a false love

I am the false king, I am here to kill, steal and destroy Blinding your vision, distorting the scriptures, I plan to destroy you (2x)

I am the false king, but my minions go my way I am the king of torment, of all pain and of all its suffering

Lacerated bodies build my kingdom of destruction Controlling those with shaken faith I build my ascension

Controlling your soul with my hands Putting all hate in your heart

"In what time have you been According to the course of this world, According to the prince of the powers of the air, Of the Spirit that now works in the children of disobedience "

(Ephesians 2: 2)

I am the false king, but my minions go my way I am the king of torment, of all pain and all its suffering
