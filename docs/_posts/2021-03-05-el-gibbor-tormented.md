**Lyrics:**

“How long will you torment me <br>
and depress me with words? You have insulted me ten times now. <br>
You’re not even ashamed of mistreating me. Even if it were true that I’ve made a mistake without realizing it, <br>
my mistake would affect only me. If you are trying to make yourselves look better than me <br>
by using my disgrace as an argument against me, then I want you to know that Eloah has wronged me <br>
and surrounded me with his net. Indeed, I cry, ‘Help! I’m being attacked!’ but I get no response. <br>
I call for help, but there is no justice. “Eloah has blocked my path so that I can’t go on. <br>
He has made my paths dark." <br>

Even after my skin has been stripped off my body, <br>
I will see Eloah in my own flesh. I will see him with my own eyes, <br>
not with someone else’s. <br>
My heart fails inside me! “You say, <br>
‘We will persecute him! <br>
The root of the problem is found in him.’ Fear death, <br>
because your anger is punishable by death. <br>
Then you will know there is a judge.”
