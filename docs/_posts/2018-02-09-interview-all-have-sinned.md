On Tuesday night, I interviewed Daniel and Matti of the deathcore band All Have Sinned from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We discuss upcoming music, gear, and the faith that drives this band.

_Jeffrey: Hey, I hope you’re doing well. I want to start this by telling us your name and role in the band?_

_**Daniel & Matti: We are doing well. My name is Daniel and I do vocals for All Have Sinned. Doing great man, my name is Matti and I play guitar.**_

_Jeffrey: What's the origin of the name All Have Sinned? Have you changed the band's name before?_

_**Daniel: We have not changed names as a band before and the name comes from**_

> _**Romans 3:23-24 “23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”  For Us what this represents is 1. The need for God and 2. the fact that we are all on an equal playing field before God. No amount of Money, social Standing or self-righteousness makes you better than any other person.**_

_**Matti: When we started this band, we were trying to find a name and we had a few other ideas but this name, “All Have Sinned,” seemed to fit.**_

> _**For me I see so many other people in the Faith use God for personal agendas and prostitute the message. We all have sinned including myself and need the grace that only repentant hearts find.**_

_Jeffrey: What genre of music do you consider your work to be? Who are your major influences?_

_**Daniel: Symphonic-slamming-orchestral-blackened deathcore haha at least on the new stuff. Some of my major influences are Sleeping Giant, In the midst of lions, With Blood comes cleansing, Aversions crown, FleshGod apocalypse, septic flesh, Broken Flesh, Aborted, Make them suffer and the orchestral music that I enjoy.**_

_**Matti: I’d say we are deathcore even though a lot of bands don’t like the label of that name. I find it to be fitting but I also don’t think it puts us in a box. I find myself influences to be Aborted, Dyscarnate, The Hate Album from Thy Art. Really, I listen to any and all types of heavy music. Just today I was listening to Tesseract. So, you get the idea.**_

_Jeffrey: How long have you all known each other? How did you meet?_

_**Daniel:  Originally, I made a video trying out for another band. When that band fell apart, that guitarist and I started writing some songs in my first apartment. Soon after we found Austin through mutual contacts. Fast forward to today after searching for another drummer Geoff from All Seems Lost connected us with our current Drummer, Josh. After we taught him the songs we began playing shows again.**_

_**Matti: Yeah so back in the day I was employed at the once wonderful world of Hot Topic and I met Daniel. He was wearing a shirt of a local band that I had heard of, so I approached him hoping that he might have been in the band or something. We ended up making a garage band that never ended up becoming something. A few years after that had passed, he posted on Facebook about guitar tryouts for the new project he was working on. So yeah that must have been back in 2013 when I tried out for AHS.**_

_Jeffrey: When did you form your band? What inspired you to make music together?_

**_Daniel & Matt:  We formed this band in 2013. The reason being we felt led to honor Christ and play the music God had put within us._**

_Jeffrey: Which songs do you perform most frequently? Do you ever play any covers? Do you have a set playlist?_ _**Daniel & Matti:  Image of Idolatry and Hope have never been removed from our set. We have covered Blame it on the holy rollers by Sleeping Giant.  Yes, we do but it changes over time.  Our set-list for our next show will consist of: an intro using parts of The Lion and The Lamb, Image of Idolatry, My Dear Wormwood, Transmission: Exorcism, Hope, then A new song we have yet to release.**_

_Jeffrey: Who writes your songs? What are the main themes or topics for most of your songs? Do you think these topics will change over time?_

_**Daniel & Matti:  We compose our songs collectively.  Our themes vary depending on what we feel like God wants us to say.  We take our lyrics very seriously.  A lot of our themes deal with Biblical truth verses the ideologies that man has created. We feel that American Christianity in particular has strayed from Biblical truth and is pushing people away from Christ rather than introducing him.  This has been our experience.  Obviously, there are exceptions and we are not here to condemn others.  We want to show love and allow God to work through us, while we step out of the way. It is about Yeshua and everyone else, not All Have Sinned. Yes, our themes will vary from time to time.**_

_Jeffrey: Could you briefly describe the music-making process?_

_**Matti: I write riffs**_

_**Daniel & Matti: Generally, we write riffs bring them together and begin the construction process from there. We will lay a few riffs out and begin to structure the song. After we have the bare bones structure we will have Josh put his spin on the drums. From there I will write the orchestral parts and once the song is finalized I will begin writing the lyrics. (Daniel) We use a piece of software called “tux guitar” to write out the song. During the process, we check tempos, structure, and harmonic structure.**_

_Jeffrey: What are your rehearsals generally like? Do you have a set time each week in which you practice or are rehearsals more spontaneous?_

_**Daniel: Matti constantly squealing on his guitar while we try to discuss things and Josh playing random djent/metalcore drumbeats. Austin trying to play abstract doom metal. I usually have my head 3 feet from the cabs trying to figure out what is up with our equipment/ sound etc. hahaha**_

_**Matti: Well we try to be professional and punctual, but someone usually forgets to bring something: Cymbals, in ears, speakers you get it. But yeah, we play to a click which allows us to be tighter and on point. We try and run through the set as many times as possible. Also, without fail Austin will warm up to “Now you’ve seen the butcher” by Deftones. We practice on the weekends, weekly.**_

_Jeffrey: How has your music evolved since you first began playing music together?_

_**Daniel & Matti: A lot of the things we are incorporating now are things that we wanted to incorporate in the beginning but did not have the means to.  Our music has also evolved as we have matured.  One thing we tried to work on with our new EP is better structure and flow.  We did not want riff salad on this ep with the occasional breakdown crouton.**_

_Jeffrey: What has been your biggest challenge as a band? Have you been able to overcome that challenge? If so, how?_

_**Daniel & Matti: Our biggest challenge has been finding new members as other members have left.  Drummers are hard to find in Oklahoma. Yes, we have overcome this challenge through networking. Still, we can not foresee the future and that is the reason we have been away for a while. However, we are back and hope you guys enjoy the new material.**_

_Jeffrey: How was the writing and recording process for Desecrate Their Graves?_

_**Daniel & Matti: The writing process was very similar to this new ep, but we feel this new ep is a more mature sound. Everything was essentially the same minus the orchestral parts. The New ep juxtaposed with DTG is us being able to bounce ideas off each other without letting our wants get in the way. Again, the new ep is more of us deciding together, what worked for the song and what did not.**_

_Jeffrey: How many instruments were used to track the EP?_

**_Daniel & Matti: With both eps, we used the traditional guitar, bass and drums set up. On the first ep, we used a Jeff Loomis Fr 7 string guitar.  On the new Ep, we used an 8 string Schecter Black ATX. With both Eps, we used each drummer’s respective kits.  I believe both Eps’ bass parts were tracked with a Bryce or Ltd 6string bass. On the new Ep, we have various instruments that are Vst’s because we cannot afford an orchestra. Although, The Harp part will be an actual harp and the opera parts will be an actual opera singer. We hope to incorporate more actual players in future releases as we grow. So, if you are interested let us know._**

_Jeffrey: You guys have teased new music for while, how’s the writing and recording process going? How do you think your new music will differ from the Desecrate Their Graves EP?_

_**Daniel & Matti: We have 5 new songs for the Ep. 6 total including My Dear Wormwood. at this current moment, all instruments are finished and we have 2 more songs to track vocals for.**_

_Jeffrey: Are you guys currently signed to a label? or are you independent?_

_**Daniel & Matti: We are currently independent.**_

_Jeffrey: Thanks for doing this. Any final words you’d like to share._

_**Daniel & Matti: You guys and God are what make us who we are.  Without you, we are nothing but dudes jamming songs out.  Keep an eye on our Facebook and Instagram for what we are doing. We love you guys! God Bless!**_
