Hatred, like darkness grows Condescending in my soul I feel that I am overcome

Oh, the loneliness and fear Trapped in one's own mind Is there refuge from myself? Oh, the Father and the Son Can relinquish my own fear Before my will is gone

A visceral plague corrodes my mind Fighting myself for what is right I must resist the urge to give in I am mortal, no control Feelings lost are all but gone As I lose myself to rectify my soul

So virulent is my mind From the ascendancy of lies Thyself inimical inside Strongholds shall manifest in time

So virulent is my mind From the ascendancy of lies Thyself Inimical inside Strongholds shall manifest
