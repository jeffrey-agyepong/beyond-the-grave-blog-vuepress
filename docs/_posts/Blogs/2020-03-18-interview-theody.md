Beyond the Grave is joined by Theody's vocalist, Lauren Kinder.

**Jeffrey: What's your music background?** Lauren: I started taking piano lessons when I was about 9 years old. I also took a few drum lessons when I was 14 because my besties and I wanted to start a band. That’s when I started writing and playing shows.

**Jeffrey: What's the meaning behind the name "Theody"?** Lauren: It means “a hymn praising God”

**Jeffrey: How did you meet the other members of the band?** Lauren: Charles and I are married, and have actually known each other since 2000! We met Chad in 2016 because we had mutual friends and THEODY needed a drummer. He filled in for a few shows and stuck around.

**Jeffrey: Who are some of your biggest musical influences?** Lauren: I grew up listening to Red and Skillet. Lately, if I listen to music it’s probably Icon For Hire, Wage War, or Bring Me The Horizon. I really enjoy a good blend of heavy and pop.

**Jeffrey: Who writes your songs? What message do you want to convey through your music?** Lauren: I’d say I have done the majority of our songwriting, but there is a good portion that have been co-written with other members or other musician friends. I tend to write to myself a lot. To remind myself of truth when I’m having a hard time, or when I need to challenge myself, or about life lessons, I’m in the middle of learning. **Jeffrey: How did you come to faith in Jesus Christ?** Lauren: I grew up in church, and learned about Jesus from my parents. I think 12 years old is when I started owning my faith more though.

**Jeffrey: We live in a postmodern society that's running headlong into relativism. How valuable do you think the Bible is to us today?** Lauren: I think it is important to read the Bible if you desire to walk with and know God, and even more so to ask the Spirit to give you understanding as you read! **Jeffrey: How would you describe your music to someone?** Lauren: I hate it when people ask what other bands we sound like because I haven’t really found a good comparison, haha! I usually say we are hard rock with electronic elements and a little screaming.

**Jeffrey: Are you independent or signed to a label? What's the reason for your choice?** Lauren: We are independent. We haven’t pursued a label. We do enjoy our freedom right now, but who knows if an opportunity will come to convince us otherwise?

**Jeffrey: What is your advice to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?** Lauren: Figure out why you want to do it. And then remind yourself of that when it gets hard. Because it will. Maybe so hard that you want to quit. And it okay to feel that way, but if your why is strong enough then you will push through the obstacles and you will grow for it. **Jeffrey: What are your biggest struggles as a band?** Lauren: Not letting setbacks get to our heads (my answer to the previous question is a lot easier said than done!)

**Jeffrey: Are you currently on tour or have any tours coming up?** Lauren: We are not on tour right now, currently we are focusing on writing. We do miss the road and our friends all around the country!

**Jeffrey: What's the best way your fans can support you?** Lauren: Listen to our music, show it to your friends. We also have a [Patreon account](https://www.patreon.com/theodyband) if you want to join us there!

**Jeffrey: What does your discography look like and what's next for you guys?** Lauren: We have 2 full-length albums, an ep, and a few singles online everywhere. We just released “The In Between” along with a music video. Like I mentioned, we are doing more writing, so you can expect more songs this year!

**Jeffrey: We've come to the end of our interview. Thanks for doing this! Any final words you'd like to share?** Lauren: Thank you for having me! And thanks for supporting music!
