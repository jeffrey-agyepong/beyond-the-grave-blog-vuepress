Beginning in 2009, Every Knee Shall Bow was formed by Shane, Drew, Cole, and DJ, creating a sturdy, immense instrumental force to be reckoned with. The act was completed with the addition of vocalist Chris Hull in late 2010, allowing the band to jump headfirst into developing a live set and showing off their unique brand of thrash-influenced death metal. After bouts of incessant live performances and determined songwriting, Every Knee Shall Bow began to gain the press and media coverage they deserved with features in several noteworthy underground metal and hardcore magazines—HM and Christian Underground among them.

It wasn’t until mid-2013 that the band released their first full-length album, Slayers of Eden, which took the metal world by storm. Packed with razor-sharp, jarring riffs, pummeling percussion, and sinister, brutalizing breakdowns, the intensity on Slayers of Eden is record-breaking. These young but masterful musicians combine clever and crushing songwriting with faith and emotional conviction to create an immersive experience that captivates the listener both on record and in person—making Every Knee Shall Bow a band you will definitely want to get on your feet for. **[\[¹](http://www.armthepit.com/artists/artist/e/e26/bio.html)\]**

I plunge headfirst Into the crushing jaws of my captor Teeth dyed crimson by blood The maw consumes my body I cast virtue aside Waywardly my spirit wanders Into the pit of my own despair

Red eyes meet my fate

I reside On this platter, I offer myself upon Torn apart by the thorn in my side

Gnashing teeth Fill me with dread I am trapped in this bed I made

Entombed by darkness My blood on the floor I've let the temptress murder me

My deeds of the night Never showing their face Bring me here time and time again My folly is predictable as time I put myself in this place of dread For the fleeting taste that will never satisfy

God intervene and take me home Broken and weary please God take me home God intervene and take me home My flesh is wicked God please take me home
