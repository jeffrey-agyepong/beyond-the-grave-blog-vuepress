[Magnify](https://diatheke.bandcamp.com/album/magnify)

> Based on Solomon's temple dedicated found in 1st Kings 8:22-52. "Magnify" is a 13-minute worship epic declaring the uniqueness and authority of Yahweh, God of the Bible. The focus is on how great He is and how small we are. Despite this, God looks upon and hears us in our distress.
