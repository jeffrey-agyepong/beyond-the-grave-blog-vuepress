You shall be as gods, Is not this lie ancient? Empty power consuming soul and flesh. The serpents tongue, deceiving light. Masquerade as power and strength! To kill the foolish, and devour the flesh. Rule over all! For death is now your master, You have tasted now your own decaying flesh, Disruption of our cosmic place. Deceived by worthless scales, Still you are blind to it's false power! As the gods of the nation's fell, So shall you, You shall be as gods!

Who has fashioned a god or cast an idol to no profit? Behold, all his companions will be put to shame, for the craftsmen themselves are mere men. Let them all assemble themselves, Let them stand up, Let them tremble, Let them together be put to shame.

Burning in the hands of my own altar. Harvesting agony, In our quest for self-divinity. Cast out from the light. Blind we walk, Powerless we are!

Is there relief from my torment? Is there Balm in Gilead? Let the sun rise on our souls, No more idols, but streets of gold!
