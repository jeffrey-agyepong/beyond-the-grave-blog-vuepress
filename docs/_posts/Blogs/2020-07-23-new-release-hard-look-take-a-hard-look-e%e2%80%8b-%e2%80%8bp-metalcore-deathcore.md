Demonic Possession

Hollow, alone, and empty. Sick, dying soul Demonic parasite now taking control Buried deep in the host, once an empty shell Filled with demonic presence, sent straight from Hell There’s only one way to redeem this man Rebuking Satan’s presence, Bible in hand Words spoken straight from scripture, the imp fears it “Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit” (Mark 5:8) Praying over you with my crucifix In the name of Christ you will submit

Seven Heads: Ten Horns

“I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.” (Revelation 13:1) Coming from the sea And the beast did blaspheme. Cursing God and his people And then it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and then to overcome all of them and power was given him over all the nations Rising, spreading wings across the sky Dripping, growing, fear in every eye And the beast did blaspheme. Cursing God and His people And then it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and then to overcome all of them And then it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and then to overcome all of them and power was given him over all the nations “I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.” (Revelation 13:1) Coming from the sea And then it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and then to overcome all of them

Holy Militancy

We were called to march boldly in faith with the whole armor of God That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil We will march through the hordes of evil with the Sword held up high With holy militancy, we fight, willing to die If God is for us, who can be against us When this battle is already won We were called to be strong in the Lord and in His mighty power For our struggle is not against mankind, but against evil rulers We will march through the hordes of evil with the Sword held up high With holy militancy, we fight, willing to die If God is for us, who can be against us When this battle is already won We were called to march boldly in faith with the whole armor of God That ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil We will march through the hordes of evil with the Sword held up high With holy militancy, we fight, willing to die
