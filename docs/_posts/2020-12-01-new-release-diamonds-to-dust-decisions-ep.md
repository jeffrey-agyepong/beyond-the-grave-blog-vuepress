Seven trumpets will mark the judgment of the living on earth Four devastations and three woes, These are seven redemptive judgments to plague earth while salvation is still possible before the close of mercy So consider the day of atonement

The end is coming

A Fire engulfs the sky, we walk these lies until we die The destroyer writhes in exile and takes the lives of the entitled As I come to this path of repentance We nailed our savior for absolution of the human race The sinners who walk along the crooked line are condemned As I come to this path of repentance The sinners who walk along the crooked line are condemned A Black sun comes over the horizon Water stops flowing, the earth starts Shaking The harbinger is coming to reap why do we question our faith Manipulated lands no longer stand, as we slap our fathers hand Where will you stand when this world can't satisfy your hands The Lord will enforce an accord which will help us take our souls by force Thus we're equivocal by those who live by the serpent's sermon

Et accepto calice gratias egit et dixit accipite et dividite inter vos

et accepto pane gratias egit et fregit et dedit eis dicens hoc est enum corpus meum quod pro vobis datur hoc facite in meam commemorationem. (Luke 22:17-19 is the translation)

I have gained the wisdom to understand What happens when a person does not to take action Time waits for no one and can’t be undone So hold on for dear life cause life is precious

His whole life he had nothing but the scars from a broken home An abusive father, a drunken mother, a family that never loved him This fear of this nightmare pushes him to take the route Which would make everything disappear

How could we forsake him how could we blame him when we were the ones who pushed him to this

Now Now we stand here criticizing his decision When we had the power to save him We had the power to save him

I have gained the wisdom to understand What happens when a person does not to take action Time waits for no one and can’t be undone So hold on for dear life cause life is precious

She had everything anyone could ask for Money friends a loving a family But she was all alone, she felt so alone If only we knew that she was alone We could have found a way to save her life We could have found a way to save her life But we stand here judging her decision

Death waits for you For all those who stand there judging their decision? Death waits for you
