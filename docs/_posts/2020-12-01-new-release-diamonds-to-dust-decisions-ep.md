<p style="text-align:center;">
Seven trumpets will mark the judgment of the living on earth</br>
Four devastations and three woes, </br>
These are seven redemptive judgments to plague earth while salvation is still possible before the close of mercy </br>
So consider the day of atonement</br>
The end is coming</br>
A Fire engulfs the sky, we walk these lies until we die</br>
The destroyer writhes in exile and takes the lives of the entitled</br>
As I come to this path of repentance </br>
We nailed our savior for absolution of the human race</br>
The sinners who walk along the crooked line are condemned </br>
As I come to this path of repentance </br>
The sinners who walk along the crooked line are condemned </br>
A Black sun comes over the horizon Water stops flowing, the earth starts </br>
Shaking The harbinger is coming to reap why do we question our faith </br>
Manipulated lands no longer stand, as we slap our fathers hand </br>
Where will you stand when this world can't satisfy your hands </br>
The Lord will enforce an accord which will help us take our souls by force </br>
Thus we're equivocal by those who live by the serpent's sermon</br>
Et accepto calice gratias egit et dixit accipite et dividite inter vos</br>
et accepto pane gratias egit et fregit et dedit eis dicens hoc est enum corpus meum quod pro vobis datur hoc facite in meam commemorationem. (Luke 22:17-19 is the translation)</br></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I have gained the wisdom to understand </br>
What happens when a person does not to take action </br>
Time waits for no one and can’t be undone So hold on for dear life cause life is precious</br>
His whole life he had nothing but the scars from a broken home </br>
An abusive father, a drunken mother, a family that never loved him This fear of this nightmare</br> pushes him to take the route Which would make everything disappear</br>
How could we forsake him how could we blame him when we were the ones who pushed him to this</br>
Now Now we stand here criticizing his decision </br>
When we had the power to save him We had the power to save him</br>
I have gained the wisdom to understand </br>
What happens when a person does not to take action</br>
Time waits for no one and can’t be undone So hold on for dear life cause life is precious</br>
She had everything anyone could ask for money friends a loving a family </br>
But she was all alone, she felt so alone</br>
If only we knew that she was alone </br>
We could have found a way to save her life We could have found a way to save her life 
But we stand here judging her decision</br>
Death waits for you For all those who stand there judging their decision? Death waits for you</br>
