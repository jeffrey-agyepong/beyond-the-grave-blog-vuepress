**World Divided** recently dropped a seven-track ep of passionate blistering metalcore. What’s that, “who’s **World Divided**” you ask? Well, that’s a really good question, and seeing as how they have a fairly limited online presence I’m not sure what to say. They are a two-piece band, _Danyal Suchta (the new clean vocalist/guitarist for Convictions),_ and _Fabian Rubio_. This duo seemingly came out of nowhere and has dropped a modern metalcore album that should get even the most jaded fan of the style to sit up and take notice.

So right from the start, I have to admit, I’m a vocals guy, and that is what makes this band shine. There are quite a few styles of vocals used throughout the album, from your fairly standard metalcore screaming, think _Micah from Oh Sleeper_, to deep gutturals, higher screams are also used to add emphasis to the emotional shifts taking place. The combination of these last two leaves a strong impression that there is someone in the band that enjoys deathcore. All that and we still haven’t even touched on the clean vocals. Depending on what the song calls for, we have an amazing range from a passionate strained near yell to mellow soulful emo (yes I went there). We even have an appearance from fellow _Convictions_ member, _Mike Felker_ on **Lost at Sea** just in case you needed a little more variety. Each different vocal style is used to set a particular tone and is masterfully used to tell the overall story of the album, and the layering they use serves to build in an atmosphere that steps out of the generic head-on sound so often found in metalcore. The musicianship behind all these vocals is superb. They go hard when needed but often flirt with some popish sounds, which they blend into a cohesive mix. Also the drums on Lost at Sea, as an example, are just a wall of glorious aggression.

There is a loose story being told in this album. Primarily it deals with someone who has long since realized that they are a sinner and are now questioning why they are even worth saving. I find the theme itself is very reminiscent of _Rival Choir or Mouth of the South_’s approach (yes I know they are the same band). What separates this from that is that it’s not a bunch of similarly themed songs put together but it is a narrative that flows from song to song. _Thousand Voices_ jumps right in with the character wondering why they deserve saving and begins a book of Job style conversation with God (who answers back throughout). Then we get some context for this as _Hand to Hold_ tells of their failure to be there for a friend and then we get Broken Past’s dealing with a cheating partner. A real one-two punch of guilt and anger. _Lost at Sea_ and _Fragments_ both touch on the growing gap being formed between the character and God, with lines such as “Is this the end of me? / I am lost at sea? / Is this the end of me / these waves come crashing” and “Who am I? / I’m empty / Please show me / A way to keep going”. The hopelessness just drips from this combo of songs. _Find Me Beneath_ particularly hits home for me as we move from being guilty and angry with oneself and move to lash out at God, demanding answers so viscerally. One wonders how this can find a positive resolution. A concern that carries right through most of the final song on the album: _World Divided_. I’ll leave off we these words spoken by _Jesus_ in the song “I will always fight for you”.

All in all **World Divided** is a metalcore band that isn’t really treading new ground, but far from being generic, they are mixing in some different sounds. The album tells a passionate and powerful story of questioning one's faith, dealing with some heavy issues, and then ultimately having _Jesus_ tear down the walls we build to keep him out. If this all comes from personal experiences of the band, then they wear their hearts on their sleeves and are not afraid to delve deep for their music. I hope there is more to come.
