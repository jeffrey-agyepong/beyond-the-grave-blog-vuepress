On the edge of this life I find myself With little but sorrow I've done much wrong to undo With no time left No tomorrow

Fallen is your servant Hypocrite is the only title Worthy of my name

I have dragged your name through the mire of human filth I have spread the hate of which you so clearly condemned

My tongue has sowed devastation And bested the devil in my haenous pride Show me the light that's within because I don't believe it's there

Why do you waste your time? Why do you pursue who is unworthy? I neither have the strength or resolve to go on

I'm done with this life What was it's purpose? Give me peace or give me rest Am I too blind to see? To see Your leading? Where are You?

I've begged for a flood yet only found a fleeting vapour How am I to thrive on dust? After all I've done My time is ending I've begged for a flood yet only found a fleeting vapour How am I to thrive on dust? After all I've done Am I more than what I've done?

My Captain, my King Are You silent? Or is Your voice falling upon deaf ears? I know the destination But not the road Tell me which way to go I hear a voice But I can't make out the words Is this a trial? Is this a test? Give me something to hold onto Give me a foothold Give me an anchor Give me a harbor Give me shelter Give me eyes to see beyond what vision permits Give me faith to endure

I grow bitter In this house of desolation Possessed of too many faults to care My spirit grows weary

I've witnessed too many sorrows to bare I know this war is Yours Yet I have not the faith too see this through God help my unbelief I know this war is Yours God help my unbelief
