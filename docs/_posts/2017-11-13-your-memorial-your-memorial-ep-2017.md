As 2017 draws to a close we say a painful goodbye to yet another great Christian metal band, Your Memorial. Your Memorial is a metalcore band from the twin cities of Minnesota formed in **2008**.

They self-released their debut album **_Seasons_** and immediately caught the attention of **_Facedown Records_**, signed to them, and put out their next 2 records **Atonement** in 2010 and **Redirect** in 2012. A year after touring for Redirect, they decided it was time to slow down from touring and focus on their personal lives, so they only played local shows and Facedown fest. In 2017, they announced they were back, but this time for a final record and they’d put **Your Memorial** to rest once and for all. This EP is based on the "Doctrines of Grace"(TULIP) taught in the Reformed tradition of the church.

The first track on their final EP is _**Degenerate**_. **Degenerate** is one of their heaviest on this EP and most progressive songs. Vocalist, Blake Suddath although mostly using the mid-range vocal style, he has a way of keeping his delivery fresh with varied vocal patterns. The lyrics of this song deal with the Christian doctrine of Total Depravity.

> We are all slaves Corrupted from within We are all slaves Defiant, depraved We are all slaves Without the power or will to change Defiant, depraved

**"Embers"** is the second track on the EP. This song starts off as a melodic metalcore song but immediately transitions into a hardcore beat. Around the middle of the song, there is a chugging section accompanied by clean vocals which just fits perfectly with the song. The lyrics deal with the doctrine of Election.

**Anchors** is about the doctrine of Particular Redemption. This song uses the analogy of a person diving into like an anchor to rescue their enemy to beautifully paint the picture of Christ atonement.

**“Steadfast”** is the last song on the EP, and is very melodic. The song has a Hands/ Everything in Slow Motion vibe to it, and that’s probably because these guys are label mates and good friends. This song's lyrics deal with going through trials and pain in this life and knowing that we have redemption in Christ, He will never lose His grip on us and one day all sadness will fade away.

> *“All things, every trial and pain One day will all fade away We know the narrow path leads to redemption Though all shall fade, hope still remains”*

**Overall**, this is a great EP, though I wished it would have been a full-length album. I won't complain too much as they've ended in perfect style with a meticulously written record.
