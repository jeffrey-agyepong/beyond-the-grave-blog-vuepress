<hr>

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four <br>
I will cause terror with fire on the house of Hazael <br>
For many sins and even more, my fury will not relent <br>
Which shall devour and consume its ancient palaces <br>
I will not turn away My anger or my punishment<br>
Because of Edom; he pursued his brother with the sword <br>
Yet I will send the flames in the walls of Rabbah <br>
The king and princes shall go into captivity <br>

Judah will be taken to a land of sadness <br>
A place of recovery, a renewal of covenant promise<br>
Wickedness has a price, a consequence<br>
And sin betrays yet again<br>

Behold, the days are coming says the Lord<br>
When I will bring the captives back<br>
The Lord of Hosts will raise a prophet from your midst<br>
Who will despise the shame of the dreaded cross<br>
Was buried, later risen from the dead<br>
Ascended in eternal glory<br>
Yet my nation has devolved foolishly<br>
And it has turned into a byword of scorn<br>

You will become an object of horror<br>
And you will sow, yet harvest so small<br>
How long, O Lord, will your wrath burn like fire?<br>
Repent of your works and return to Me<br>

Redemption is here to stay<br>
We will hear you from afar<br>
I will exalt you aloud<br>
The exile will pass away
