This song is written for those who are in the midst of suffering. We hope you find comfort in these words!!

### lyrics

I'll take this to my grave Give me the gift of martyrdom Be it in the wilderness Or in an ivory casket

May my bitter resolve resonate through your conscious May my legacy be of whom you couldn't silence

Alive or dead I am at peace Alive or dead I am eternal

I find purpose at the completion of this mortal stage Before I transcend I'll scar the earth immortalized in history's page

Death is nothing but a means of my message Blot me from this earth and I'll reign in the next

Cut out my tongue and my voice will soar through the ages

This is where I depart the earth as a servant I'll return as a king

Nothing in the sky above or in the earth below, will sever me from my God So come pain, come war for I have seen, what's yet to be I am called to royalty, and I'll take this to my grave

When I wake I will see my saviors face When I wake I'll see this world fade away When I wake I will see my saviors face When i wake
