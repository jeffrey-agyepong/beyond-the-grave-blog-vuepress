**Heliocentric** is a Metalcore band full of progressive and atmospheric elements.

Heliocentric is a band that has a lot of potentials, not only because of their talent to write and structure incredible songs, but because of how conceptually elaborated and carefully touchable lyrics, and how they bath the whole sound of their music in a heartbreaking atmosphere, that propriates worshiping the Lord.

When I started listening to this Full Length, I was thinking, this was just another Metalcore band, heavily influenced by **Fit for a King** (especially on their masterpiece, **Dark Skies**), **Silent Planet** (**The** **Night That God Slept** comes to my mind because of the atmospheric elements), **The Devil Wears Prada**, and **Oh, Sleeper** (they gave me a **Children of Fire** vibe). At the first moment, I wasn’t really impressed. But conform the album was playing, I just realized how every song went better than the past ones and listened how the album itself was powerfully evolving with every single song, and I just couldn’t stop headbanging since the third song. Then I understood this is an album that I will treasure forever in my playlist, my heart, and my Metalcore top 10. As you can notice I´m comparing these guys with really successful Metalcore acts that have reached commercial levels, and dear reader, it´s not a coincidence, I believe this band is going to be mainstream soon.

The album starts with a strong atmosphere sensation in **To Those Who Found Rest**, maybe not the best song of the album, but the correct one to start with, intense, fast, and introducing the aggressive sound you´re about to present. **Pray for the Emperor** is a really good song, with intensity, and emotion-filled vocals. Breakdowns at this point were pretty into the Dark Skies style. I have to emphasize the great drum work in this song, pretty enjoyable, and the riffs are easily headbangable.

I think the really impressive part of this album starts with **Rome**, I find this a more characteristic sound for these guys, with extremely powerful lyrics, like poetry, awesome atmospheric chords, but also an intense constant breakdown that will blow your headphones away. I especially liked the vocals in this one, beautifully executed cleans (reminded me of **A Day to Remember**´s). I also wanted to highlight this quote from the lyrics because it is absolutely beautiful to me “Pray for me that I might bear the Name, not unjustly, unashamed, Christian”. To calm the intensity of Rome comes **Liturgy** a beautiful interlude, pretty atmospheric, which is a great opening to **Phrygia**, a song filled with dissonant riffs and progressive beats, against the false preachers. This song feels like a hurricane, with awesome screams and growls from the vocalist.

**God of Apathy** and **God of Empathy** is probably the pinnacle of the whole album, they´re just perfect songs, flawless and a great duo of songs that show the true nature of God in their lyrics, a humble God full of empathy that came to the earth to die in our place. I think the spoken part in God of Apathy is deeply beautiful, Christian poetry at its best, simply worship. And the way it builds up is amazing, absolutely love the beat and the cymbals at this point. This particular song made me think of one of my favorite Metalcore bands ever, **Your Memorial**. God of Empathy displays the same amount of energy and emotion, giving more textures to the sound with more clean vocals. This song also has some of the best riffs I’ve got to listen to this year. Both songs have sort of a perfect close with **Visio Beatifica**, an interlude that recovered the general atmospheric sound of the album. These kinds of interludes show some kind of “Chapters” structure that I like, dividing the album into three parts.

**Perpetual** is another solid song, probably a little influenced by bands like **Norma Jean** because of its chaotic looped riff. Vocals were awesome, absolutely brutal growls that could fit perfectly in a Melodic Death Metal band and match pretty well with the sound. **Felicity** comes more structured, and with a more vulnerable and emotional feeling, that is pretty soulful and touching. **Flicker** is my favorite song on the whole album, I can totally identify with its lyrics and the drum beats are bestial, this is how I want my Metalcore to sound. The final song, **Witness** has also pretty beautiful lyrics, but the vocals still don’t convince me, maybe it’s my personal opinion, but based on the rest of the album, I think they could have been better executed in this song.

Lyrics are very powerful, strongly based on the bible and in the life of the first disciples of Jesus, and how they were persecuted by His Name, and how all those struggles didn’t matter to them, because basically, they put their hope in heaven and not in this present life. Poetic, beautiful, and encouraging Christian lyrics, that I think we all need these days.

This album is wonderful and is a great input to what this band can become. I think some things could have been done better, probably most of them are production-related, and that’s why I won’t rate this album with a ten over because honestly, I think this won´t be their best album. I´m pretty excited about what these guys are doing next, my expectation is pretty high for their upcoming projects, because the amount of talent here is amazing, and I’m pretty sure their next material will be better and totally amazing.

**Heliocentric** dropped a new album at the end of 2019. This came on my radar as a call to review the album came in. I thought progressive metalcore, yup I'm down for that. So here we are, many weeks later (life happens…) and I have to say this album takes you on quite the journey.

Let’s get the obvious comparison out of the way right here at the start. This album is very inspired by **Oh Sleeper**; it comes with a lot of musical and tonal shifts within songs and has some vocals that are reminiscent of _Micah’s_. Now with that said **Heliocentric** is not a copycat or clone of **Oh Sleeper,** while it pays respect to its influences it diverges in many ways as well. We start with a mood-setting intro, almost sounds like someone tapping on piano keys with some atmospheric sounds in the background. It quickly drops into a heavy rock sound with some screamed vocals. It serves to set the mood for what is to come. One of the strengths of this album is that it maintains a steady djenty beat throughout the album. There’s a grinding gallop that forms the base of the sound but thankfully they don’t rely solely on this base. Instead, they use it to springboard into other sounds (this is a progressive album, after all). From this base they transition to slower interludes, **Rome** and **God of Empathy** have a couple of the many examples of this. At other times they just drop into intense breakdowns, see **Phrygia** and **Flicker**, for example. There is a lot of guitar work that happens almost in the background throughout that helps set the progressive tone they are going for. Again the driving djent sound is the foundation, but the ethereal guitar work adds a nice counterbalance to everything else they are doing. One of the strongest aspects of this album is the transition both in the songs and between songs. They are masters at flowing from the heavy to the softer sounds and back again. Plus if one isn’t listening carefully it can at times be difficult to notice the change from one song to another, not because it’s monotonous but because one song naturally leads into the others. This may sound like a critique, but I do mean it as a compliment as it lends solidarity to the album. I am thrown off a bit by the various interludes on this album. They aren’t bad and they do serve to break up the lyrical themes, but for my preference, I would have rathered they just continue to drive ahead. To finish the musical discussion, I really want to highlight **Perpetual**. This is probably my favorite song on the album. While the other songs do a great job adding the atmospheric guitar work, this song’s use matches the lyrical tone and lends a creepiness not heard elsewhere. Considering the tone of the lyrics, it would have been a disservice to this song for it to not stand out.

Vocally this album is quite diverse. As mentioned above there is a sound reminiscent of Micah’s, and this is the primary style throughout, but they are not afraid to experiment. There is an amazing use of death like gutturals sprinkled all over the album. Occasionally those gutturals get a bit muddied, as in **To Those Who Found Rest** and **Felicity**, which I find a bit disappointing. It may be done on purpose for effect, but I just want to hear them better. This may be why songs such as **Phrygia** (not to mention the higher-pitched black style vocals that appear here), **God of Empathy**, and **Flicker** stand out so much for me. There are a couple of instances of the spoken word as well, and they are so varied that they never feel excessive or overused. **God of Apathy** mixes a traditional spoken word with passionate screaming. **Phrygia** mixes in what sounds like Latin prayers that have a sinister sound, and **Felicity** adds a female voice for its foray into the spoken word. Now we move into my main critique of the album. I just don’t like the cleans on the first couple of songs when they appear. **Pray for the Emperor** stands out for this. They are very jarring in the context of the song and really fell flat and unemotional. I was concerned about that being something that would bother me throughout the album but later appearances of the cleans work much better for the songs, **God of Apathy**, and even become a highlight of the song, **Flicker**. I’m not sure why the later clean vocals suddenly have so much more passion and suit the song better but I’m very glad they do. **Lyrically** this album has a ton of depth. It’s a concept album set during the time of the early Christian Martyrs. Jared (the only member of the band) has done his work putting these songs together. Looking through the lyric sheet provided we find that everything in the songs is researched and footnoted. Beyond the obvious use of the bible, we see references to early church father’s writing, **_Clement, Polycarp, Tertullian,_** _and_ **_Ignatius_** to name some. _Jared_ also refers to more modern biblical scholarship and even throws in a reference to a My Epic song (admittedly that reference made me chuckle as it really stands out). Coming back to the concept, the album tells a consistent story and breaks up each section with the musical interludes I mentioned before. We start from the physical present, questioning why there is persecution for the crime of faith (**Pray for the Emperor** and **Rome**) “What other crime is punished so incongruently? Sentence us for our confession While denial is cursed with acquittal”. From here we move to the struggles of the believers at the time, from dealing with heresy and deception amidst the struggles (**Phrygia**) to questioning the persecution on a more spiritual level (**God of Apathy** and **God of Empathy**). The rest of the album is the transition from questioning to understanding and accepting the call on their lives, as hard and consequence-filled as it may be. Perpetual stands out in this regard as it expresses and acceptance but questions how this martyrdom will affect others, particularly family and friends. It also has one of the most poignant sets of lyrics “Am I a masochist Shrouded in the guise of a saint? Today I will be fathered by God while I leave my child a dismal orphan”. When I’ve read historical accounts of martyrs, I’ve always had a nagging wonder at their motivations. This song goes a long way to helping to understand the thought process, the personal challenge it must have been for them to make some decisions and sacrifices they did.

There is so much depth to this album. I do question a little whether this would have a mass appeal with its very specific concept and story. On the other hand, it does serve amazingly well as a refresher on early Christian faith that speaks to the struggles we have as believers today. While we are not being killed for our faith, we can look to this true story for encouragement. It’s also wonderful that the inner turmoil and struggle aren’t glossed over. It’s uplifting to think that the past heroes of our faith never had it easy and that in their struggle we can find hope (obviously never forgetting Jesus!).
