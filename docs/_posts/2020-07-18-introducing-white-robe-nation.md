I feel like I am lost again I need some redirection Can someone bring me back to life? Please give me resurrection

Will you find your way home again? Won't you trust in Me? (I) I AM the way, the truth, and the life I Will be your light

Prodigal (II) Come to me weary and burdened I will give you rest

(III) Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called... your... son

Bring me back to life Bring me back to life

Will you bring me back to life? I need you to be my guiding light I am shattered inside I don't want to give up the fight

Lord please... give me rest Jesus... give me rest

Come now find your rest in Me He said, return to the light!

Will you find your way home again? Won't you trust in Me? I AM the way, the truth, and the life I Will be your light

Prodigal Come to me weary and burdened I will give you...

Rest! Come home Come home

Come now, find your way home again You can put your trust in Me I AM the way, the truth, and the life I Will be your guide

Prodigal Come to me weary and burdened I will give you... \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I - John 14:6 II - Matthew 11:28 III - Luke 15:21

This track is about coming back home and finding the love that awaits you. When we lose our way, when we feel like we can't go home because we messed up too bad. We are always welcomed with loving arms by Jesus Christ.

(I) "He satisfies, the deepest longings of our hearts and our lives. I wonder how many more sermons it would take to win you to Christ, how many more warnings will God have to give you. And how many more graves would have to be dug, how many more wars will have to be fought, how many earthquakes, or tornadoes and floods will have to come before you make your decision. The thief on the cross took that one moment and said "Lord, remember me" and in that moment Jesus said, "Thou, shalt be with me in Paradise." That quick, you can make your decision and commit"

And through it all you'll see my face transfixed on the throne of Grace I refuse to look away don't look away

What will it take to reset our gaze to the one who protects Who set the earth in motion

What will it take for believers across this world to remember who is in control

This is a pandemic watch as the earth quakes Shake us into place Shake us back into place

Oh how small we are Yet we believe we are as giants

We've forgotten who reigns when the rains come

We think we are the cure but we are disease The cure has already been found

And through it all you'll see my face transfixed on the throne of Grace I refuse to look away don't look away

He said... (II) Fear not For I am with you Fear not

So through it all you'll see my face transfixed on the throne of Grace I refuse to look away don't look away

Chris started to write the lyrics a few weeks into the major Covid-19 Lockdowns starting in March, 2020. The song is a call to believers to put their trust and faith in Jesus rather than living in fear of everything around them. It also comes a timely moment after major protests sparking in the United States over police brutality, and racism. We must come to understand one another, to love our neighbors as ourselves. In one sense then our human sin is a pandemic to the world, to the Kingdom of God. But thankfully we have access to the cure, Jesus Christ.
