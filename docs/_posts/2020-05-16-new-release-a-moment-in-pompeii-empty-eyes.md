**_[A Moment in Pompeii](https://web.facebook.com/amomentinpompeii)_** is a metalcore act that strikes a balance between technical and melodic songwriting. AMIP features heavy down-tuned guitars and bass that holds down rhythmic breakdown sections, fast aggressive leads, and melodic choruses are mixed in for good measure. The lyrical content of our music often touches on the struggles that we face that others do not see, in our hearts and in our heads, while also exploring the concepts of renewal and recovery**_._**
